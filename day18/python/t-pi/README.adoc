== AoC21-18: Snailfish
https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/18

=== Info

Do the math addition homework ... in snailfish maths with nested pair numbers, exploding pairs if nesting gets too deep and splitting if numbers get higher than 9...

* Star1: Evaluate (explode / split) addition of snailfish number series. Calculate "magnitude" of resulting expression.

* Star2: Evaluate all homework snailfish number pairs and find highest magnitude

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line and preprocessed.

* Star1: Write parser for expression by eval() of string. Ugly extensive nested ifs/isinstances. Long bug hunt for rare case of double splits ðŸ™„. 

* Star2: Struggled with shallow copy effects, spoiling the main list. Eval string expression just prior to usage --> another ugly hack...

=== Learned today

* Do not forget to return directly after recursive function call, else active part might get called twice...

* Got reminded of the f* by reference handling of those deeply-nested lists
