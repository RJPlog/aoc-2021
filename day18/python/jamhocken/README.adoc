== What I learned

. Working with match objects from regex

== Approach

. I just read in the lines and strip them and put them into a list.
. Star 1
.. After some thought, I didn't have any better idea than to leave everything as a string and parse it.
.. I setup a loop that stops if neither condition is met.
.. For explode
...I regex to find the pairs that could explode. And then count up the [ to the left (subtracting closers if any).
... If more than 4, then it explodes. I scan through to see if there are any numbers to the left or right and do the addition and substition.
.. For split
... It's actually easy. I just check for any double digits and do the substition.
. Star 2
.. I use the same code as before and just run 2 nested loops and keep the max magnitude while running through.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
