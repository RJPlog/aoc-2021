== AoC21-20: Trench Map 
https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/20

=== Info

Improve 2-bit image with image processing (3x3 sliding window to determine position in image processing table)

* Star1 (*): Amount of pixels after two iterations of image processing

* Star2 (**): Amount of pixels after 50 iterations...

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line and preprocessed into dict of bright pixels (1) and image_processor list. The catch (thanks to reddit!) was, that 9 unlit pixel generate a lit one and vice versa - on an infinite canvas... üôÑ. Two things follow:

1. Every uneven iteration leads to an infinite canvas of lit pixels -> an even number of iterations is necessary to have a countable results.

2. By simply iterating the image processing with a growing canvas, the border starts to get ugly from unhandled border conditions and spoil the result.

The approach here is to "pump" the canvas: every uneven iteration grows (by 8 pixels on every side, empiric determination...) to generate a solid border of lit pixels, then every even iteration's canvas gets reduced (by -4 pixels per side, same procedure...) to avoid the ugly border condition and end in a cleanly lit border.

* Star1: Iterate manually twice

* Star2: Further(!) iterate 48 times

Result canvas is plotted.

=== Learned today

* Same bug was found *much* faster this time, that iteration happend 52 times üòÅ

* Eric can be mean with his puzzles. Reddit can be useful üôÉ
