== What I learned

. How to do the equivalent of elif in a list comprehension.

== Approach

. I read in the enhancer and just leave it as a string.
. I put the trench values into a dictionary with the x,y coordinates in a tuple as the key
. Both Stars
.. I create a loop.
.. First, I add a frame of entries to my dictionary around the current grid of the current dictionary.
.. Since the parts outside of the grid could be "#" (the zero value in my enhancer was "#"), you have to be careful here.
.. Then you just find the values for all of the neighbors, join it to be a binary string and use the decimal conversion as an index into the enhancer string.
.. At the end, you just add up the lit squares.
.. It's not super efficient, but it still runs in a few seconds.

== Run script
