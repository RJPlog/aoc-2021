== What I learned

. Used a deque

== Approach

. I read in the 2 positions and put them into a list.
. Star 1
.. I used a deque to represent the die.
.. You just iterate through until one of the players reaches the score.
. Star 2
.. I realized that there are 27 different die roles for 3 dice. But, there are of course not 27 different sums of the three.
.. I created a dictionary with the keys being the possible sums and the values being how often they occur. e.g. 3 happens only once. 6 happens 7 times.
.. I created a dictionary with the score and position of both players as the key. And how often that combo occurs as the value.
.. Then, it's pretty straightforward. It just loops through figuring out all combos on each turn. If one of the player wins, we add the universes to its win sum value.
