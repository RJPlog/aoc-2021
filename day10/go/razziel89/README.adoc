== Day 10: Syntax Scoring ==

This is my implementation for both rounds of the syntax scoring puzzle.

=== Oveview ===

This solution contains a `solution.go`, which defines the main executable.
There is also a `stack.go`, which contains specifications of a FIFO.

`solution.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::solution.go[tags=solution]
----

`stack.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::stack.go[tags=stack]
----

There are currently no tests.

=== How to run ===

Assuming the required input is in a file `input.dat`, you only need to execute
`cat input.dat | go run .` to run the solution.
