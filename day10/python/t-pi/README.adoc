== AoC21-10: Syntax Scoring 
https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/10

=== Info

Navigation Subsystem on the fritz: Find corrupt data

* Star1 (*): Find closing brackets (of four kinds ([{<>}])) with no opening counterpart (corrupt lines) and calculate score

* Star2 (**): Discard corrupt lines and calculate scores for _incomplete_ lines and take middle score of result list

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line and prepocessed into list of strings.

* Star1: Clean each line from completed pairs until line length stays constant. Then check for any remaining closing bracket and use that to calculate score

* Star2: Use cleaned lines from Star1 and iterate from back to forth through chars to calculate score

=== Learned today

Simple counting of brackets was not enough for part1, I had to switch to actually considering opening and closing brackets. I'm glad that removing full pairs worked rather well - also for part2.

But of course I fell once more for the "middle position" in a list, with the index starting with 0... ðŸ™„
