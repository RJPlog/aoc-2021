....
The score is determined by considering the completion string character-by-character. Start with a total score of 0. Then, for each character, multiply the total score by 5 and then increase the total score by the point value given for the character in the following table:

): 1 point.
]: 2 points.
}: 3 points.
>: 4 points.
