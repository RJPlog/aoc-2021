== Day 19: Beacon Scanner ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19[AoC|2021|19].

The solution for today's puzzle takes ~10 seconds to complete in my current implementation (optimized from 30 seconds in the first version)! Currently, I have no idea how to simplify.

=== Parts 1 & 2 ===

To keep the code clean, I created some shortcuts for 3D coordinates:

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=coordinate]
----

The input is read as follows:

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=parse]
----

Then I define all 24 possible transformations

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=trafos]
----

which are used to figure out whether two scanner's ranges (or two sets of beacons in their own coordinate systems) overlap:

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=check_overlap]
----

With these elements, the solution to both parts is calculated as follows:

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=solution]
----

=== Tests ===

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=tests]
