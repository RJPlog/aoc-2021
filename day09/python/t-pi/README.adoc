== AoC21-09: Smoke Basin
https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/9

=== Info

Determine 2D minima in cave floor (height: 0 .. 9)

* Star1 (*): Consider adjacent (l, r, t, b, no diagonals) fields

* Star2 (**): Fill minima up to height 8 and determine size (extension in positions) of basin. Multiply 3 largest basins.

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line and prepocessed into 2d int list

* Star1: Straightforward, check for lower adjacent field for every position. Just make sure to have the comparisons right ðŸ™„

* Star2: Take recursive approach comparable to floodfill (thanks @rdmueller for the pointer in Slack ðŸ˜…). Don't forget to mark visited positions...

=== Learned today

No easy hacking with head full of booster aftereffects...
