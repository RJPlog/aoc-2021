=== First Star

How does it work: +

For the first part I read in the puzzle input and added a frame outside, one line with '9' on each side. For evalation of risk level, I went through the map and checked, if the adjacent tiles are higher or lower. If all are lower, you found a sink and added it to the result (+1)

=== Second Star

How does it work: +

The second part is nested into part one, whenever a sink is identified, a function is called, which evaluates the size of the basin arround. All basins are stored into a list, the result is calculated by multiplication of the three largest.
