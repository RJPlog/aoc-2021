== Day 00: Hello World ==

Maybe I'll try out some https://www.ruby-lang.org/[Ruby] this year. At least a hello world is done ;)

=== Solution ===

The actual solution resides in `solution.rb`

It will define classes, methods and similar to calculate the solution, e.g., 

[source,ruby,numbered]
----
include::solution.rb[tags=say_hello]
----

And a section to run the actual solution and measure time, like

[source,ruby,numbered]
----
include::solution.rb[tags=run]
----

The part `if __FILE__ == $0` is taken from https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/4/[Ruby in Twenty Minutes]

The solution is executed with `ruby solution.rb`

=== Test ===

To test my code, there will be a `solution_test.rb` file, which defines a test class derived from `Test::Unit::TestCase`:

[source,ruby,numbered]
----
include::solution_test.rb[tags=test_class]
----

Tests are executed with `ruby solution_test.rb`
