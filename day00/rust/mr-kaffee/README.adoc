== Day 00: Hello World ==

It'll be another day of https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust] solutions for the 2021 edition of 
https://adventofcode.com/2021[Advent of Code]

=== General structure ===

Generally, my solutions will contain a `src/main.rs` file which reads the input from `input.txt`, 
calls the solution functions and measures time.

The actual solution will be implemented in `src/lib.rs` file.

The `lib.rs` file also contains the tests in a separate submodule. I will use this for test-driven 
development, e.g., based on the examples given in the puzzles.

=== Run Solutions ===

Run solution with `cargo run` (or `cargo run --release` to see the effect of compiler optimization)

Run tests with `cargo test`

=== Run all Solutions ===

My `day00` solution this year will run all my solutions. At this time, it looks as follows
