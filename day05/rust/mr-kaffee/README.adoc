== Day 05: Hydrothermal Venture ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5[AoC|2021|05].

=== Part 1 & 2 ===

I played around a little bit how to best represent lines. Eventually, I decided to simply represent them as tuples ```(x1, y1, x2, y2)```

I initially decided to count vents in a flat list representing the relevant part of the ocean's ground. To identify that relevant part, I have a function to determine the bounding box of all lines.

Later on, I realized that a lot of other solutions used hash maps to keep the counters. So I wanted to try that as well and see the runtime impact. I made my solution generic using a trait ``VentsCount`` and implementing it for ``HashMap`` directly and for vectors using a struct ``VecVentsCount`` with a bit of extra information on the bounding box.

The solution is then build by iterating over all lines and for each line iterating over all points it contains and increment a counter for the coordinate of that point. Then count all coordinates which belong to more than one line (have counter value greater than 1).

To iterate over the points, I calculate deltas ``dx`` and ``dy`` that define the difference in the x and y coordinate from one point to the next. They can be one of 0, 1, or -1.

Whether or not to include diagonal lines is controlled with a flag ```include_diagonal``` which is set to ```false``` for part 1 and ```true``` for part 2.

=== Today I learned ===

A range is empty, if the upper bound is less than the lower bound.

It is not easy to write functions in rust that return iterators, since the actual type of the iterator depends on how it is constructed. Implementing an iterator on your own is not always worth the effort.

Sometimes, it is a good idea to use signed types even if all the results are positive. This allows to deal with negative increments much more directly.

Hash map based counting may come with a runtime penalty. In today's puzzle, vector based counting performs three to four times faster.
