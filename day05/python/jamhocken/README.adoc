== What I learned

. I refreshed regex for myself (again).

== Approach

. I parse the file with a regex and create a list of all of the vectors.
. For star 1
.. I check if the line is vertical and iterate the value in a dictionary for each coordinate on the line.
.. I then check if it is horizontal and do the same.
.. I then check the dictionary for any values more than 1 and sum over the number of those entries.
. For star 2
.. I still do the horizontal and vertical checks.
.. And then do the diagonal lines.
.. I think this could be simplified / shortened, but I didn't bother.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
