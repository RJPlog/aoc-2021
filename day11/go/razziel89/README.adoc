== Day 11: Dumbo Octopus ==

This is my implementation for both rounds of the dumbo octopus puzzle.

=== Oveview ===

This solution contains a `solution.go`, which defines the main executable.
There is also a `utils.go`, which is currently where all helper functions that
might be re-used later on reside.
There is also a `grid.go`, which contains specifications of a grid and other
geometrical functionality.
This solution reuses quite a bit of the day 9 solution, which was based on the
day 5 solution.

There are currently no tests.

=== How to run ===

Assuming the required input is in a file `input.dat`, you only need to execute
`cat input.dat | go run .` to run the solution for both parts.
