== What I learned

. Brushed up on modula arithmetic.

== Approach

. I parse the file and strip the carriage returns from the lines.
. I put everything into a single flat list of integers.
. I created a function to do one step and used it for both stars.
.. Basically, I just use a set for the indexes of octopuses that flash.
.. I add one to the octopuses and see if anything flashes.
.. If so, I add those indexes to the set.
.. I then start a loop.
.. And then I add one to their neighbors (lots of code to check the edges) and check if any of them are more than 9 *and* not already flashed.
.. Repeat until no new flashes occur. Return the new state and the number of flashes that occured.

. Star 1
.. Do 100 steps and add up the flashes.

. Star 2
.. Loop until all Octopuses are 0.
