== Day 08: Seven Segment Search ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8[AoC|2021|08].

=== Part 1 ===

For part 1, the most difficult part for me was to parse the input. In the current version, I parse the unique patterns and outputs to integers, where bits `0` to `6` correspond to wires `a` to `g`

Counting the unique outputs is simple

=== Part 2 ===

For part 2 I did not really have a good idea and tried around for a while. What I came up with is a map of wires to candidate segments. I iterate over all unique patterns and exclude candidate segments for each wire.

For patterns with 2, 3, or 4 wires, the 2, 3, or 4 corresponding segments are known.

For patterns with 5 or 6 wires, the unused wires correspond to one of 4 or 3 segments, respectively.

Once all patterns processed, the map is further reduced by removing segments which are the only candidate left for one wire from the candidates of all other wires.

That was enough in my case to end up with a unique mapping.

==== Alternative Solution ====

I looked at the solution by https://github.com/RJPlog[RJPlog] later, which is actually much simpler than mine. Here is a Rust version of his decode idea.

Run the alternative solution with ``cargo run --release --features rjplog_solution``

Not only is this solution simpler but it also runs faster. With compiler optimizations turned on, my original part 2 solves in about 1ms, the alternative solution takes about 0.1ms.
