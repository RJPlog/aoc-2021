== AoC21-08: Seven Segment Search 
https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8

=== Info

Interpret garbled seven segment display with two data structures (input | output)
* Star1 (*): Identify easy digits by counting only output digits with uniquely identifiable length (1, 4, 7, 8)
* Star2 (**): Identify all digits and construct single output number from digits. Sum all output numbers

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line and prepocessed into list of (input | output) lines
* Star1: Just check output digits for length and count the uniquely identifiable digits
* Star2: 
 * Identify ambiguous digits by checking for containing segments from 'one' resp. segments from 'four' without 'one' ("crochet")
 * Construct string number output digit by digit
 * Return int(result)

=== Learned today

Had to sort out the identification of digits on paper for lean solution. Long live the pencil! 😁
