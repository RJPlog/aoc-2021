== Day 08: Seven Segment Search ==

This is my implementation for both rounds of the seven segment puzzle.

=== Oveview ===

This solution contains a `solution.go`, which defines the main executable.
There is also a `utils.go`, which is currently where some helper functions are.
There is also a solution in bash in the appropriate directory.
Part 1 has been solved based on the solution of part 2.
This implementation brute-forces the solution by generating all possible
mappings and checking each one for validity.

`solution.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::solution.go[tags=solution]
----

`utils.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::utils.go[tags=utils]
----

There are currently no tests.

=== How to run ===

Assuming the required input is in a file `input.dat`, you only need to execute
`cat input.dat | go run .` to run the solution for both parts.
The solution for part 1 will be output second, preceded by that for part 2.
