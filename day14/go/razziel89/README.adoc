== Day 14: Extended Polymerization ==

This is my implementation for both rounds of the extended polymerisation
puzzle.

=== Oveview ===

This solution contains a `solution.go`, which defines the main executable.
There is also a `utils.go`, which is currently where all helper functions that
might be re-used later on reside.
There is also a `rep.go`, which contains specifications of a replacement
specification.

`solution.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::solution.go[tags=solution]
----

`utils.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::utils.go[tags=utils]
----

`rep.go`
[source,go,numbered]
----
include::rep.go[tags=rep]
----

There are currently no tests.

=== How to run ===

Assuming the required input is in a file `input.dat`, you only need to execute
`cat input.dat | go run .` to run both solutions.
Part 2 might take a while.
It uses goroutines and achieves some degree of parallelisation this way.
It's by no means great, though.
