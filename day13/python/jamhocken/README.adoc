== What I learned

. This one was actually straightforward

== Approach

. I parse the file and create a list with all instrucions and a set with all coordinates.
. Both Stars
.. I look at each coordinate and compare it to the cutting line.
.. If it's above or to the left of the line (depending on vertical or horizontal cutting line), I put the coordinate into the new set.
.. If it's not, I mirror it to the right spot and put it into the set.
. Star 1
.. Do the first instruction and find the length of the resulting set.
. Star 2
.. Do all of the instructions.
.. Print the coordinates in a grid. (# for present, . for absent). Read the letters in the ASCII graphic.
.. I didn't right a parser to read the 8 letters, but did it manually. :-)

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
