== AoC21-16: Packet Decoder
https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/16

=== Info

Decode long hexadecimal packet with several sub-packets

* Star1: Sum up version info from all packets and sub-packets.

* Star2: Carry out encoded operations in packets and calculate final score of main packet.

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line and preprocessed. Today single line and preprocessing is main task of star1...

* Star1: Write parser to parse packet hierarchy and sum up version info.

* Star2: Improve parser to carry out operations as well and calculate final score of main packet. As parser from Star1 produced already recursively a list of all packets, the aggregation operations were just a small addition. Still did unelegantly copy the parser functions and separately implemented the code execution... üôÑ

=== Learned today

Getting better with recursive stuff. There are probably lots of libs out there to do the parsing with two lines of regex, but my hands-on approach worked, too, in the end. Part 2 was thus quite easy to add in the end, after no more duplicate packets were in the final packet list üòÅ
