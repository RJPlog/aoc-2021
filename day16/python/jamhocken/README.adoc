== What I learned

. Hex and Bin manipulation in Python

== Approach

. I take the line from the file and turn it in to a binary string.
. To decode the transmission and find the sums and the versions, you basically just follow the instructions.
. Honestly, it's mostly just reading the requirements closely and not creating any unnecessary bugs in the code.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
