== Day 16: Packet Decoder ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/16[AoC|2021|16].

=== Part 1 ===

A lot to read today. But then it is just following the instructions.

I implemented a structure ``Packets`` to keep track of the current position and read numbers from the bits & bytes (I am particularly proud that I got the bit ordering right from the beginning):

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=packets]
----

The input is parsed into that structure with

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=parse]
----

Then, part 1 is solved with the function ``sum_versions`` which calls itself recursively:

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=sum_versions]
----

=== Part 2 ===

For part two the function ``sum_versions`` is modified to take into account the operators. The new function ``process_packet`` reads:

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=process_packet]
----

=== Tests ===

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=tests]
