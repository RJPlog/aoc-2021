== Day 12: Passage Pathing ==

This is my implementation for both rounds of the passage pathing puzzle.

=== Oveview ===

This solution contains a `solution.go`, which defines the main executable.
There is also a `utils.go`, which is currently where some helper functions are.
This solution also re-uses the counting set implementation of day 3 in
`set.go` but using integers instead of string tokens this time.
It also contains a `stack.go` and a `node.go` that implement a stack and a node
with connections, respectively.

=== How to run ===

Assuming the required input is in a file `input.dat`, you only need to execute
`cat input.dat | go run .` to run the solution for both parts.
The solution for part 1 will be output first, followed by that for part 2.
