Advent of Code 2021

== Python

Parse the data into a list of nodes and edges to construct a graph. For the first star, use a recursive function to generate all paths starting at a certain node until the end. When being called on a small node, the node is removed from the graph to ensure that the node is only visisted once.

The approach from the first star can not be easily extended to the second star, since the function assumed that it did not matter how a certain node was reached. So for the second star a new function was written which extends a path by one more node while ensuring that only one small node has already been visited.
