==  Day 12: Passage Pathing  ==

This solution is written in Kotlin.

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/12

For execution enter _kotlin day2112_1_2.kts_ in the command line.

=== First Star

How does it work: +

All possible pathes are build up step by step, each new path is checked if following the rule. As an extension for part 2 the 'followPath' function has an input paramter which is able to switch to a new rule. All path which came to an end are stored in a separate list.

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2112_1_2.kts[tags=followPath]
....

=== Second Star

How does it work: +

Solution for this part is integrated in function 'followPath' by just choosing an other rule to be applied. Since the rule does need some lines of code, I separated it into a new function 'ruleCheck2'

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2112_1_2.kts[tags=ruleCheck2]
....

At the end, both solutions are printed out. 

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2112_1_2.kts[tags=output]
