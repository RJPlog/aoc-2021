== What I learned

. Some basic math. :-)

== Approach

. I take the line from the file and use a regex to extract the 4 numbers and put them into a list.
. Star 1
.. This is just math. If the probe goes up with a certain velocity, it is guaranteed to come back down through and exactly hit zero.
.. The velocity when it hits zero will be negative and its magnitude is the initial velocity + 1.
.. So, the max velocity is the absolute value of the bottom edge of the target area minus 1. And the maximum height is then also clear.
. Star 2
.. Maybe there is a cool math solution, but I didn't find it, so I just brute force this by trying all theoretically possible initial velocity combinations and playing it through for each.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
