== AoC21-17: Trick Shot 
https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/17

=== Info

Shoot probe into target area under the influence of drag and gravity.

* Star1 (*): What is the highest culmination point possible?

* Star2 (**): How many start velocities are hitting the mark?

=== HowTo

Data is read from the file 'input<two-digit-day>.txt' line by line and preprocessed into target_x and target_y ranges.

* Star1: Determine min velocity_x to reach target. Iterate through large enough range to hit all possibilities. Return max height.

* Star2: Use length of results list. Increase range of velocity_y to negative start values ðŸ˜…

=== Learned today

There's always a range+1 initial value that might still hit the target ðŸ™ƒ
