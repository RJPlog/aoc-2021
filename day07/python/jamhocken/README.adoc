== What I learned

. Straightforward.

== Approach

. I parse the line and convert to integers.
. For star 1, it's just statistics.
.. The optimal spot is the median.
. For star 2
.. If you start going through all possible values, it might take a while.
.. So, I used the median as my starting point and looked if the fuel consumption is improved by increasing or decreasing from there.
.. Then, I just iterate through until I come to the other side of the global optimum and take the value before that.
. It's probably not optimized, but it only takes a few seconds to run.

== Run script
