=== Problem Star 1
[quote]
....
Crab submarines have limited fuel, so you need to find a way to make all of their horizontal positions match while requiring them to spend as little fuel as possible.
....
=== Test
[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/lib.rs[tag=testdata]

This means there's a crab with horizontal position 16, a crab with horizontal position 1, and so on.
....
==== Testcase
[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/lib.rs[tag=test1]
....

=== Solution
Calculate used fuel for each position 
[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/parser.rs[tag=calculate_fuel]
....

and find minimum.

[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/main.rs[tag=star1]
....

=== Problem Star 2
[quote]
....
As it turns out, crab submarine engines don't burn fuel at a constant rate. 
Instead, each change of 1 step in horizontal position costs 1 more unit of fuel than the last: the first step costs 1, 
the second step costs 2, the third step costs 3, and so on.
....

So for calulating fuel we use gaussian sum.
[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/parser.rs[tag=gaussian_sum]
....
and use same algorithm. 
[source,rust,numbered]
....
include::src/main.rs[tag=star2]
....
