How does it work: +

Puzzle input is read into a map with coordinates as key and cucumbers or free spaces as value. Within a while loop first the cucumbers facing east are considered moving, than the cucumbers facing south. As long as any cucumber has moved, the loop continues.

After no cucumber moves any more, the number of steps is printed out as solution.
