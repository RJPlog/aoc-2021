== What I learned

. Somehow I don't understand slices with lists in Python, but at least I do understand it for matrices with Numpy.
. The whole thing isn't very elegant, I'm afraid.

== Approach

. I parse the file and put all of the codes into a list of lists.
. For star 1
.. I take that list of lists and turned it into a Numpy matrix. I then sum each digit over all
codes and compare that sum to half of the number of codes to find the majority digit for Gamma.
.. I then used some modula arithmetic to find the inverse Epsilon.
.. Converted to strings, joined it and converted to integers.
. For star 2
.. I go through each digit and cull out the codes that don't belong to the majority / minority.
.. I recalculate the majority / minority evey run through the loop with a Numpy matrix again.
