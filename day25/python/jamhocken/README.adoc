== What I learned

. Deepcopy on lists of lists. (Although I already knew this theoretically)

== Approach

It's actually straightforward. I put the input into a list of lists.
I iterate over the lists of lists and check for ">"'s  and move them to the right if possible and wrap if necessary.
I do the same then for the "v"'s.
I set a flag if anything moves in a round. And leave the while loop as soon as nothing has moved in the round.
I count the rounds on the way. That's it.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
