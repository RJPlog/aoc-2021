https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15[AoC|2021|15].

=== Solution ===

Dijkstra!

Parse:

[source,rust,numbered]

include::src/lib.rs[tags=parse]

Solve (call with ``d = 1`` for part 1 and ``d = 5`` for part 2):

include::src/lib.rs[tags=solve]

I somehow messed up with part 2 and could not figure out what I did wrong. I generalized the code for part 1 to see whether it still solves part 1 and all of a sudden it also solved part 2. Don't know what I got wrong in the first place.

Possible optimization: use A* with the min steps to target (``width - x + height - y``) as heuristic.
