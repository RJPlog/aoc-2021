== What I learned

. It is straightforward as soon as you see that you only have to count the fish.

== Approach

. I parse the line and convert to integers.
. Then I count how many fish are in each of the possible fish states (9 of them).
. For both stars, you just create a loop with the right number of days.
.. You write the number in state 0 into state 8.
.. You add the number from state 7 to the number from state 0 and put it into state 6.
.. All others follow the rule state n is written to state n-1.

== Run script
